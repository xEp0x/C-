Exercise 1: SmartArray

Implement a SmartArray<T> class that uses dynamic memory
- Must be RAII, but STL containers/smart pointers NOT allowed
- Has size, has index access (with operator[])
- Can be resized
- No support for copying or assignment
Bonus: even more RAII
- Donâ€™t use (directly) new in methods
Bonus: enable iteration (e.g. with range-based for loop)


Exercise 2: Rule of Three for SmartArray

- Implement the Rule of Three for the SmartArray<T> class
- Bonus: implement it using the copy-and-swap idiom
