These submissions are solutions by the author done a few weeks after the tasks were created, to test the difficulty of the exam.

They have some differences from the original solutions, as the author tested how fast they could be done, without giving much consideration to them being readable for students.

Even so, the author feels viewing slightly different solutions to the problems may be of use to the students, hence these are provided.
