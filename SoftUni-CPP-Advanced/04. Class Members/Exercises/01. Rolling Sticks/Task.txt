Exercise 1: Rolling Sticks
You are given code that animates sticks
 Represented on a line on the console
 "roll" by changing their symbol and position on the line
 Symbols: start from _, then \, then |, then / and back to _
 Position starts from 0. When symbol becomes | – move to next
 The code already does the animation, you need to implement a
Stick class that keeps and updates the state of a Stick
 Implement the code in a Stick.h file included by the
RollingSticksMain.cpp file
