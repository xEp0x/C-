Exercise 1: FollowPointers

You are given the following main.cpp file and a Node.h file
- main.cpp declares a function int getSumFrom(Node* node)
- Node.h file defines what a Node is
Create a FollowPointers.h that implements the function
The function should calculate the sum
- Of the value fields, from the provided node
- Moving by going to the next field, until nullptr is reached
Write #include "Node.h" in your file to use the Node code
